/****f* SchedulerPrivate/scheduler_dispatch
 * SUMMARY
 * Dispatch a thread.
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 */

status_t scheduler_dispatch (thread_t thread)

/*
 * ARGUMENTS
 * * A valid thread_t 
 *
 * FUNCTION
 * In the first part of the test, we check whether a distant, compatible CPU is
 * available. If not, if the thread is compatible with the current processor,
 * and whether this processor is available or not, we return that it is
 * necessary to invoke the scheduler. It will be the role of the calling
 * function to decide what to do.
 *
 * RETURN:
 * * DNA_BAD_ARGUMENT: thread is not valid
 * * DNA_INVOKE_SCHEDULER: success, invoke the scheduler on return
 * * DNA_OK: the operation succeeded
 *
 * SOURCE
