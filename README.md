# DNA Kernel

DNA is a kernel designed for embedded systems such as (MP-)SoCs. This project is based on a fork of [this project](http://tima.imag.fr/sls/research-projects/application-elements-for-socs). It is currently going through heavy restructuration and, unlike the original version, it is not immediately usable yet.
